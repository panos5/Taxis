extension: "more massenger groups can join the queue as the simulation progresses "
if you cannot make it work by typing the name of group along with the number of passengers, 
i have already the code in the controller (journeyload) with which you can select a file (a new one) with the passengers groups.
in this case the only that is missing is a button and the 'connection'
